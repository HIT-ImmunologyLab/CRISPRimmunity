## Background

The CRISPR-Cas system is a highly adaptive and RNA-guided immune system found in bacteria and archaea that has applications as a genome editing tool and is a valuable system for studying co-evolutionary dynamics of bacteriophage interactions. This repository presents CRISPRimmunity, a new tool designed for Acr prediction, identification of novel class 2 CRISPR-Cas loci, and dissection of CRISPR-associated important molecular events. CRISPRimmunity is built on a series of CRISPR-oriented databases that offer a comprehensive co-evolutionary perspective of the CRISPR-Cas and anti-CRISPR protein systems. CRISPRimmunity also provide a web server, offering a well-designed graphical interface, a detailed tutorial, and multi-faceted information, making it easy to use and facilitating future experimental design and further data mining. The web server is accessible without registration at http://www.microbiome-bigdata.com/CRISPRimmunity/index/home.

## Install

### Linux

- step1: Clone the repository of  CRISPRimmunity from Github

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HIT-ImmunologyLab/CRISPRimmunity.git
```

- step2: Download CRISPRimmunity database and data for standalone from CRISPRimmunity webserver and check MD5

Due to the large size of the database file (~XXXG), we recommend using -c (continue) and -b (background) parameters of wget to avoid the data loss caused by network outages, and checking MD5 to verify the integrity of the downloaded files.

```shell
## md5 checksum: XXX
### Download Database
wget -c -b XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
### Check md5 (e2ac0981ab07b4529d857c5c778f30e6 )
md5sum database.tar.gz
### Download Data 
wget -c -b XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
### Check md5 (6f577bbc661276e597b237f80870f2b0)
md5sum data.tar.gz
```

- step3: Unzip the database and data file to specified subdirectory under CRISPRimmunity installation directory

```shell
### Unzip the database file
tar -zxvf database.tar.gz
cp -r <download_database_path>/database <CRISPRimmunity_path>/CRISPRimmunity
### Unzip the database file
tar -zxvf data.tar.gz
cp -r <download_data_path>/data <CRISPRimmunity_path>/CRISPRimmunity
```

When you organize the whole files well,the corresponding directory structure are displayed as shown below. <br>

## Example

In the CRISPRimmunity package, there is a directory named "example" which includes input sequence and result for examples of three modules.  "Armatimonadetes-bacterium-isolate-ATM2-J3.gb"  is used for identifying novel class 2 effector proteins.  "Staphylococcus-schleiferi-strain-5909-02.gb" is used for Acr prediction and annotation of important molecular events, respectively.

```python
## run the example
